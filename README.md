# Analysis-on-UK-Traffic-Accidents

### Aim:
The aim of this project is to analyze the UK government's extensive dataset on traffic accidents (real time data from 2004-2017) to uncover causative factors and propose evidence-based solutions for enhancing road safety, utilizing data models and visualizations for comprehensive insights.


### Motive:
Our project aims to investigate the underlying causes of traffic accidents in the UK and propose strategies to enhance road safety. By conducting in-depth analysis, we intend to shed light on the factors contributing to accidents and provide data-driven recommendations.


### Outcome:
Our project will result in the creation of data models that offer a deeper understanding of accident-related data. We will also generate visual representations to facilitate the comprehension of accident causation factors.


### Description:
The UK government often gathers and shares detailed information about car accidents that happen all over the country. This information includes things like where the accidents occur, what the weather was like, what kinds of vehicles were involved, how many people got hurt, and how the vehicles were moving during the accidents. This collection of data is very useful for people who want to study and understand accidents better.
